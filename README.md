# Data Analysis with Python Final Project
This repository was a final project on the dicoding course "Data Analysis using Python (in english)". The course uses a lot of techniques in analyzing data and uses various python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Streamlit. Streamlit is being used as the dashboard here. Though I've encountered some bugs with the streamlit GUI.
